<h2>Welcome!</h2> 
  
I'm Rachel, a Spring 2022 Computer Science Graduate who likes developing streamlined, maintainable code.

### Projects
#### CoronaCast
In 2020, I worked together with three fellow University of Florida students to create an email subscription service that would regularly update users with Covid-19 data from a chosen area. We scraped data from the news sites and predicted the number of new cases in each area that week based on previous weeks' trends.
